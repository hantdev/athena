# Project Athena (Cloud-based IoT Platform) - Graduation Thesis HUST 20242

## 1. Abstract

The global IoT market is gaining momentum. According to [MarketsandMarkets forecasts](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/internet-of-things-market-573.html), the global Internet of Things market size is expected to reach USD 650.5 billion by 2026. The impact of IoT on [enterprise connectivity and exponential revenue growth](https://www.businessinsider.com/internet-of-things-report) cannot be underestimated. Business Insider claims that by 2027, the IoT market will grow to over \$2.4 trillion annually.

Additionally, [Statistaâ€™s predictions](https://www.statista.com/statistics/976313/global-iot-market-size/) indicate that the global market for IoT end-user solutions is expected to reach around \$1.6 trillion by 2025.

With these statistics in mind, there is a booming demand for IoT among businesses seeking [custom IoT development services](https://euristiq.com/iot-development/) for their IT projects. This thesis aims to develop a cloud-based IoT platform that is independent, scalable, and secure. The platform will focus on device connectivity, data processing, and seamless cloud integration.

## 2. Introduction

IoT platforms provide essential infrastructure for connecting, managing, and analyzing data from IoT devices. This project will build an open-source, cloud-native IoT platform designed to support large-scale IoT deployments. The thesis will explore the key architectural components required to develop such a platform, including communication protocols, security mechanisms, and scalability strategies.

## 3. Objectives

- To design and develop a scalable cloud-based IoT platform.

- To implement key features such as device authentication, data streaming, and API-based integration.

- To compare the developed platform with existing IoT cloud platforms.

- To evaluate performance, security, and scalability.
